Node.js is seen as the ideal runtime environment for many web developers.

Node.js was designed to run code written in JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it allows a wide community of developers to construct server-side applications.

Node.js offers the ability to reuse code via JavaScript libraries, however selecting the appropriate libraries may be difficult.

Useful libraries may shorten development time and provide several advantages for your web application, such as quicker load times and decreased application bundle size.

When picking a library, consider the application’s complexity, the community supporting the library, the frequency of updates, and the quality of its documentation.

Node.js libraries are maintained through the Node.js package manager, npm, which may assist in the installation of various open-source libraries.

I have picked 13 important Node.js libraries that make web development simpler.

Node.js is a server-side runtime environment for JavaScript programming that is open source.

Its asynchronous nature and cross-platform interoperability make it a popular web development base.

Node.js uses event-driven and non-blocking I/O, making it extremely efficient in real-time distributed systems that deal with large amounts of data.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*pv8TR0iMv8eTqfmq.jpg)NodeJS Libraries

A library, sometimes known as a module, is pre-written code that encapsulates regularly used operations.

You can utilize libraries to speed up the coding process and encourage code reuse, which will help you keep your work “DRY” (don’t repeat yourself).

Libraries, as opposed to frameworks, are finished functionality that can be easily used in a project at any stage of development.

A framework, on the other hand, generally serves as a skeleton for a whole program, with substantial influence over how it is created.

Let’s have a look at 13 of these Node.js libraries and see what they have to offer.

1. Sequelize
------------

[**_Dotenv_**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a Node.js utility module that maintains application environment variables and protects critical configuration data.

Dotenv also assists the application in saving environment variables per the twelve-factor app methodology.

When the dotenv library is configured early on, the environment variables from.env are immediately injected into provess.env.

**Dotenv Library Features and Benefits**

*   Allows you to segregate secrets from the source code, such as API keys and login credentials, and allows each developer to establish their own.env file.
*   Because of its zero-dependency module, it does not add to the size of the program.

There are many helpful libraries available in Node.js, but choosing the ideal one for your project might be tough.

Some of the Node.js libraries discussed in this post might turn out to be “must-haves” for your future application.

For example, if you do a lot of work with MongoDB, Mongoose can be a lifesaver.

CORS can assist you in keeping up the data across multiple domains at the same time, and Dotenv is especially useful if you need to share code — but not secrets — inside a team.
