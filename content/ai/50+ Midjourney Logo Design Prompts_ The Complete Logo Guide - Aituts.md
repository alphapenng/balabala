> Generate the perfect logo for your brand with these curated Midjourney prompt templates and technique......

One of my favorite things so far about Midjourney has been **AI-logo** **design** (here are some other [amazing prompts to try in Midjourney](https://aituts.com/midjourney-v4-prompts-to-try/)).

When you get a low-quality logo designed for your brand, or don't have a logo at all, you are doing yourself a major disservice. **Because a logo isn't just a pretty image.**

It's a shorthand for all of the values that are important to your brand.

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-3-1024x527.png)The most recognizable logos in the world

**There's an entire world behind each of these graphics**. When you see one, something remarkable happens. Consciously or subconsciously, your brain is flooded with stories, emotions and experiences. And it happens in an instant: the human brain processes images **[60,000 times](https://oit.williams.edu/files/2010/02/using-images-effectively.pdf)** faster than text.

Maybe you were using a cheap logo as a temporary placeholder. Or you threw something together yourself because a professional designer was too expensive.

There's no excuse to have a low-quality logo anymore: **with** **Midjourney you can create a professional quality logo design at a [fraction of the cost](https://aituts.com/midjourney-pricing/).**

You can find these logo design prompts, as well as 50+ other practical prompts for applications like Graphic Design, Web Design, Illustration & Photography in our **free Midjourney prompt book:**

Tips for starting
-----------------

**Simple prompts do better.** Start your prompts with "`logo design for...`" and go from there.

**Text doesn't work great yet in Midjourney**, but if you know how to use Photoshop or free alternatives like [Photopea](https://photopea.com/) or [Canva](https://canva.com/), you can easily replace the text with your own.

**Use designers & artists in your prompts** who are good at the style you are looking for. Here's a list of well known [graphic designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_graphic_designers) and [artists](https://arthive.com/artists) to get you started.

**If you're feeling creative**, use other types of designers such as [fashion designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fashion_designers) and [architects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_architects) in your prompts.

**If you aren't familiar with Midjourney parameters**, review this [parameter and command cheatsheet](https://aituts.com/midjourney-cheatsheet/) (with prompt examples) to get up to speed.

1. Pictorial Mark Logo (Graphic)
--------------------------------

A pictorial mark, also known as a brand mark, is probably what you have in mind when you think "logo". Think of the iconic Apple logo, the Twitter bird, the Shell logo:

You can pair your mark with text, but the mark **must be able to exist by itself.** Because of this, it can be a tricky logo type to use for new companies without strong brand recognition. You want to aim for something:

*   Appropriate to your brand
*   Distinctive & Memorable
*   Simple

**Midjourney tends towards complexity** so you must tell it you want the opposite.

Here are some legendary designers that I recommend for this specific style:

*   [Paul Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand) - designer of the IBM & ABC logos
*   [Rob Janoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Janoff) - designer of the Apple logo
*   [Sagi Haviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagi_Haviv) - designer of the US Open tennis logo

**Tip: Use** `**[--no](https://aituts.com/midjourney-negative-prompts/)**` **to specify what you** _don't want_ **in your images.**

Type `--no` and follow it up by all the things you don't want, word by word.

I'm explicitly telling Midjourney I don't want 'details' or 'realism' or 'shading'.

This command is very powerful and very underused. Midjourney defaults to a realistic & detailed style. This command releases it from that constraint, and can improve your results considerably.

**See our guide to [using negative prompts](https://aituts.com/midjourney-negative-prompts/).**

### Minimal Line Marks

Minimal line marks have been popular for a while now - you can either create images of things or geometric shape and line designs.

```

### Gradient Marks

Use gradient marks to give your brand an innovative feeling. You can even specify what colors you want within your prompt.

### Japanese Style Marks

Japanese graphics have a distinct aesthetic and sensibility that Midjourney is excellent at capturing.

```

2. Lettermark Logo
------------------

Lettermarks, or Monograms, are logos that consist of letters, usually brand initials: IBM, AMC, NASA. The full names of these companies can be too long or too boring (seriously, how many people know that AMC stands for...._American Movie Classics_?) so these brands have opted to officially go by their initials.

Many tech companies use a single-letter lettermark (in addition to their wordmark) because this makes a great app icon:

Unfortunately, Midjourney cannot produce words, but it can generate single letters:

Typography vocabulary is your friend:

*   Serif
*   Slab
*   Calligraphic
*   Blackletter

3. Abstract/Geometric Logo
--------------------------

An abstract mark is a specific type of graphic logo.

Instead of being something recognizable like apple or a bird, it’s an abstract geometric form that represents your business.

You can add '`radial repeat`' to prompts to make a circular pattern.

4. Emblems
----------

An emblem logo consists of font intertwined within a detailed symbol. Think of badges, seals and crests. Emblems are often set on shield shapes (coming from a 900-year-old tradition of knights displaying their emblems on their shields) however they do not have to be.

These logos tend to have a very official appearance, thus they are the go-to choice for schools, universities, countries, and governmental departments.

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aitu_emblem_for_a_university_with_large_book_vintage_ccd8e9a6-6d84-43dd-9380-1eb68dbf8302.webp)

### Modern Game-Style Emblem

Clean, modern emblems are a popular choice amongst content creators like Youtubers who are trying to stand out visually from the crowd:

5. Mascot Logos
---------------

A mascot is an illustrated character that represents your company.

Midjourney is great for creating all types of 2D characters that are perfect for mascots.

6. Using Graphic Designers
--------------------------

You'll notice we've used a lot of designers in our prompts above. **If you've been experimenting with these you'll notice they have a huge impact on the output.**

Here's a longer list of designers you can use:

*   [Paul Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand) - designer of the IBM & ABC logos
*   [Saul Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass) - designer of the [Vertigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_(film)) movie poster
*   [Massimo Vignelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Vignelli) - designer of the [New York City Subway Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway_map)
*   [Rob Janoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Janoff) - designer of the Apple logo
*   [Sagi Haviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagi_Haviv) - designer of the US Open tennis & National Geographic logos
*   [Ivan Chermayeff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chermayeff_%26_Geismar_%26_Haviv) - designer of the Chase and Pan Am Logos
*   [Steff Geissbuhler](https://geissbuhler.com/) - designer of the NBC and Time Warner Cable logos

Note that not all designers are represented in Midjourney's model. We've chosen some ones that we noticed consistently produced good results.

7. Using Creative People
------------------------

Let's get trippy. In your prompts, try using creative people who aren't "graphic designers' per se to get very interesting styles. Here are some suggestions to get you started:

*   **Character Designers:**
    
    *   Yoji Shinkawa - designer for the Metal Gear Solid series
    
    *   Yoshitaka Amano - designer for the Final Fantasy series

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aitu_simple_minimal_logo_of_chicken_style_of_yoji_shinkawa_175ba26a-8593-43e8-8bc0-e21195b9ef51.webp)

```
simple minimal logo of chicken, style of Yoshitaka Amano --no letters font
```

*   **Painters:**
    *   Egon Schiele - portrait painter known for his twisted intense work
    *   Paul Klee - abstract painter known for his use of color and shape
    *   Piet Mondrian - painter known for his abstract geometric grids with primary colors

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aitu_simple_minimal_logo_of_chicken_style_of_egon_schiele_23fa9301-2092-4b2b-9459-c291bd1ccef1.webp)

Add text to your logo
---------------------

_Combination marks_ are logos that integrate symbol and text together.

Sometimes this means they are so tightly integrated they cannot be separated (Burger King logo).

Other times this means the logo has a symbol that can be used by itself, text that can be used by itself, and a combination of both (Rolex and Lacoste logos). This allows the brand to be more versatile in their logo placements.

We've generated many graphical logo marks with Midjourney. You might want to make a combination mark by paring your graphic with high-quality font.

Here's how I recommend you do it:

### Remove background

You want to remove the background because you want _transparency_ that will let you to place your logo on any background color.

I recommend [Adobe's Free Background Removal Tool](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/remove-background). While you do have to sign up for an account, this is the only background removal tool I've found that is completely free (it doesn't make you pay for higher resolution). Another alternative is [remove.bg](https://remove.bg/).

### Add text

I recommend [Canva](https://canva.com/) for adding text. Apart from the fact it's ridiculously easy to use, it comes preloaded with many logo templates so you can look for fonts and compositions that you like.

After signing up, search for "logos" in the templates.

Select a font you like, then use Canva's simple interface to import your image, and edit the text. You can change check out Canva's many fonts.

And there's the finished result:

How to fix bad text
-------------------

Midjourney (and other AI generators) can't do text very well...yet.

For the time being, we'll have to do some manual work. I'll use this one as an example:

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kevin__emblem_of_a_kaiju_simplejapanese_36e07d8c-d6f7-4708-b63d-0fbb938a5197-1.webp)

Let's say I generated this for my new beer brand called _Kaiju Beer._

### Identify the Font

If there's a font you want to use, go ahead. I like the feeling of the font that Midjourney gave me though, so I'll try to use something similar.

If you're not familiar any fonts (I'm not), there are sites that let you upload an image of text, and they will give you fonts that look like the one in the image. I recommend [WhatTheFont](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont):

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-28-at-12.49.24-PM.webp)Upload the image to WhatTheFont

The **Alphacal Black JNL** looks pretty close:

You can buy the font directly from the website.

Alternatively, you can do a quick Google search and download yet another lookalike font. I used [Online Web Fonts](https://www.onlinewebfonts.com/) to find a pretty close lookalike.

### Use Photoshop or Photopea to Swap Text

I love [Photopea](http://photopea.com/). It's completely free and has a lot of the same functionality as Photoshop.

Here, I've imported my logo design into Photopea.

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-28-at-1.05.18-PM-2-1024x701.webp)

Then I'll import the custom font. Click on the [Text Tool] -> [Name of Current Font] -> Load Font.

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Frame-201-1024x699.png)

To get rid of the existing text, use the Healing Brush Tool.

Alt / Option + Click to sample anywhere in the background of the image, then use that sample to paint over the text:

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Frame-200-1024x699.png)

I put in my text, then apply my custom font and color. And that's the complete logo!

![](https://149868225.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kevin__emblem_of_a_kaiju_simplejapanese_36e07d8c-d6f7-4708-b63d-0fbb938a5197-1.jpg)Finished!

And that's how you can make a finished logo with Midjourney!

Midjourney V3 was something like a black box. It was unpredictable and required a lot of prompt-tweaking to get what we wanted. [V4](https://aituts.com/midjourney-v4-prompts-to-try/) on the other hand, gives us results that are much closer to what we want straight out of the box. [V5](https://aituts.com/midjourney-v5/) introduces a new level of realism.

As Midjourney and AI tools keep on improving, we can only imagine that this trend continues. We're excited to watch as all types of designers start to incorporate these tools into their workflows.
